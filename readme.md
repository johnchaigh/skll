SKLL

Recruiters are more than ever using ATS systems to review thousands of applicants for job roles. Quite frequently, an applicant can slip the ‘net’ for not including the exact keywords this system might be looking for.

Skll will parse any job description, identify the keywords and compare them to the contents of your resume. It will score the comparison out of 100 and offer some keyword suggestions to help it perform better!

Created as a final project for CS50.

This is a web application built in Flask, using a SQLite3 database.

Feature list:

Resume parsing and skill extraction
Profile creation and job hunting from skills list
Job / resume comparison and scoring
Resume improvement suggestions for better performance
